UB Overview
=============

5 major scenes 
Authenticate
Character Select
Profile
Gameplay
Social

Authentication 
You can build to iOS or Android or use the development mode (a flag on the Authentication controller) to test in the editor.


All playfab code is spread across many PF_XXXX classes
PF_Bridge - has some basic PF helper fuctions and callbacks
PF_Authentication 
PF_Gamedata
PF_GamePlay
PF_PlayerData


Singletons and other core scene components
 * GameController (iconmanager, cdn)
 * DialogCanvasController (interstitial, loading, & other overlays)
 * SceneController (request scene change)
 * Event call back system



Known issues--
MVCesque with the PF classes acting as the model, and the controllers for major UI components.
Sloppy inconsistent use of callbacks and event queuing that would need to be cleaned up be for releasing to the public
needs commetns
needs removal of unused scripts and assets. There is alot that can be condensed and removed
screen refrehes after certain actions, too many PF data calls (IMO)
centralization of animations
redo the sprite packing of the assets
lots of unused vatiables that can be cleaned up
